# Server API settings

server.api = "fastcgi"				# fastcgi -- preferred API
						# scgi	  -- simplefied FCGI API -- yet another alternative
						# cgi	  -- Use only in case you application does huge amount of work
						#            such the fork()+exec() time in neligable
						#            Recomended for debug purposes only

# Server work mode

server.mod="process"				# process -- process runs single instance of worker thread. Very simple 
						#	     suitable for server that manages process startup/shutdown
						#	     This is only mod that supports CGI api
						# thread  -- thread pool execute several instances of worker. More dengerous
						# 	     in terms of faults -- thread crashes causes server crash
						# prefork -- "Apache Style" module -- the process forks into several 
						# 	     worker process and each worker thread has its own process

# server.procs = 5				# Default 5 -- Number of worker process for mod prefork
# server.threads = 5				# Default 5 -- Number of worker threads for mod thread

server.buffer = 100				# Default 1 -- relevant for multi-threaded model
						#              How many requests may be "on-hold" even if
						#              thread pool is full. Also sets "listen(2) backlog parameter

server.socket = "/tmp/hello-fastcgi.socket"     # Default is "" -- use default socket given
						#              by web server -

# server.disable_xpowered_by	= 0		# Disable X-Powered-By header (default enabled)
# server.buffer_reserve		= 16000		# Set default inital buffer size of output page
						# Default is 16,000 -- set to cover most of page
						# sizes that are used by your CMS

# ZLib Compression: 

# gzip.enable = 1				# Default 0 -- Enable gzip compression recomended to turn on
# gzip.level = 1				# Default: zlib defailt, defines compression level 
# gzip.buffer = 4096				# Default: zlib default, defines buffer size for zlib

# cache.backend = "fork"			# Default "none" -- defines the cache backend to be used 
						#        "threaded" inprocess server suitable only for mod thread
						#	 "fork"     suitable for mod prefork only uses shared memory
						#	 "tcp"      distributed suitable fork any other mod (TODO)
# cache.limit = 100				# Default 100 -- number of cached entries for cache threaded
# cache.memsize = 64				# Default 64  -- the size of cache in KB for "fork" cache backend
# cache.file = "/tmp/mymem"			# The location of cache mmaped file/semaphore
